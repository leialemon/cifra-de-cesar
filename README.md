This is a simple program coded in java to encrypt input words using Caesar's cypher.
It was developed as a way to practice what I learned in the first module of ADA's B3+ inclua course.

USAGE: Initialize the program and type the word you want to encrypt. 

ATTENTION! In its current state, the program only works with the 26 letters of the latin alphabet.
Support to other ASCII characters to be added sometime in the future.
